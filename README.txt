SUMMARY:

This was just a quick program I made whilst bored with my internet being down.

This was designed to work on Linux, and has not been tested
on anything other than Debian 10. I don't have any plans on
expanding on this but you can do what you want with it.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Create a new directory called build within the source directory.
cd into the new directory and type "cmake .." and press enter.
After cmake compiles a make file, type "make && sudo make install",
this should first compile the binary and then install it within the
/usr/bin directory.
